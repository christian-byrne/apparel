## Overview

This webapp will server as a wardrobe manager app. It will work similarly to how a kitchen manager app would work -- by saving recipes (outfits) and suggesting recipes based on avaialble foods (clothes).

The user will, over time, enter information about the items in their closet and about outfits that they wear. The extent of detail will depend on the user, but they will have the option to enter a large array of data. The most important fields will be those inputs that are crucial to the app's algorithms. 

The app will then use various algorithms to suggest outfit combinations -- in a way acting as a stylist, and incorporating staple fashion advice practically such that the user doesn't have to learn it for themselves. 

Perhaps more helpful than the algorithms, the app can simply server as a log of outfits. There can be a large benefit to having a list of outfits (characterized by each constituent item) and a rating system attached to those oufits -- as well as other sorting parameters like temperature, formality, and so on.
